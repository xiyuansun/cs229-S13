*                   CS229 PROJECT 2 - CELLULAR AUTOMATA                       *
*******************************************************************************

The goal of this project was to make a set of utilities that read in a custom
file format (aut files). The project was presented in such a way that we needed
to think about design as we were programing. This was due to the project being
released in 3 parts of varying difficulty, with each part building off the
previous parts. The utilities are listed with a short description below:

    showgen: Displays a generation calculated from an aut file.

    sim-tui: Displays a Textual User Interface for simulating aut files.
             Requires ncurses to build properly.

    sim-gui: Displays a Graphical User Interface for simulating aut files.
             Requires QT4 to build properly.

*                            BUILD INSTRUCTIONS                               *
*******************************************************************************

To build all utilityies, run the command 'make' in a terminal pointing to the
project directory ('make all' works as well). Each individual utility can be
build using the command 'make' followed by the utility name. All binaries are
stored in the build folder, and all .o files are stored in the build/objects
folder.

It is also possible to build debug versions of the utilites (except sim-gui)
with the 'make bug' command. The debug binaries are stored in the debug folder,
and the debug .o files are stored in the debug/objects folder.

Other make commands that have been included:
    make clean              : Clears all files created by the build process
    make tarball            : Makes a .tar.gz file with all source files.
    make debug/[utility]    : Makes the debug version of a specific utility.
                              Once again, this does not include sim-gui.
