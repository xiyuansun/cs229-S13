/*           CS229 PROJECT 1 - SOUND FILES           */
/*****************************************************/

The goal of this project was to make a set of utilities
that manipulated sound files in a variety of ways. These
utilities are listed with a short description below:

    sndinfo: Display basic information about a sound.
    sndcat : Concatenate sounds by length.
    sndchan: Concatenate sounds by channel.
    sndmix : Additively mix multiple sounds.
    sndgen : Generate a sound based on given input.
    sndplay: Create a sound from an ABC229 file.

/*****************************************************/
/*                BUILD INSTRUCTIONS                 */
/*****************************************************/
To build all utilities, run the command 'make' in the
terminal. Each individual utility can be built using
the command 'make' followed by the utility name. All
binaries are stored in the build folder, and all .o
files are stored in the build/objects folder.

It is also possible to build debug version of the
utilities with the command 'make bug'. The debug
binaries are stored in the debug folder, and the
.o files are stored in the debug/objects folder.

Other commands included are as follows:
    make clean           : Clears all files created by
                           the build process.
    make tarball         : Makes a .tar.gz file with
                           all the source files.
    make debug/[utility] : Makes the debug version of
                           specific utility

Here lies a list of every source file included in the
tarball, as well as a description of that file's
contents.
